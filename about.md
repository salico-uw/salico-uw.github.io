## Mission
*Salico* aims to develop solutions to improve the efficiency of existing farming solutions to support the broader marine aquaculture industry.

We've partnered with Dr. Wenhao Sun from [Olakai Hawaii](https://olakai-hawaii.com/) to work on automation of the sea asparagus harvesting process.

## Team
The team consists of Max, Joyce, Kevin, Daniel Z, and Daniel Q, all in their 4th year of Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

On top of the mission, *Salico* and projects are designed to meet the requirements of UWaterloo Engineering's [Capstone Design](https://uwaterloo.ca/capstone-design/) project.
