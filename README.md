## How do I create a new post?
Make a new file under `_posts/`, such as `_posts/2024-09-15-myfirstpost.md`. Add the following header in the file:
```
---
layout: post
title: <Insert title here>
---
INSERT YOUR CONTENT HERE
```
Then, simply write your content in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). This will be rendered into HTML automatically.
Once you're done, create a pull request. Once merged, it will be deployed automatically, takes about a minute.
