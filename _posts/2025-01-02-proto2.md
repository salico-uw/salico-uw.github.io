The team gathered and started assembling the second prototype! Some progress notes:
- Created harnessing for 12V regulator and pneumatic electronics
- Assembled and tested pneumatic circuit, compressor filled tank up to 105psi in 1min 40s, and was automatically stopped by pressure switch until pressure dropped below 85psi. Currently when the system is idle, small leakages cause it to drop from 105psi to 85psi in 8min 50s
- Validated dual roller motor spin along with conveyor motor spin, had to re-pick conveyor PWM pin to not interfere with other PWM timers
- Replaced PWM pulldowns with the use of a pulled-down enable pins (for roller motors and conveyor motor) to disable drivers on reset, preventing the jolt
- Improved harnessing using protoboard
