## New Controller Module

The new controller module brings a huge quality-of-life upgrade from the previous electronics wiring setup.
With proper JST connectors for the angle sensors and the consolidation of many old modules into one single board, having this new board makes wiring much less prone to mistakes and a lot faster.

## E-box

The previous e-box was simply plastic tupperware. Unfortunately, this was not as weather-resistant as we'd like (and not aesthetic enough for the symposium). Therefore, we want to pivot to proper e-boxes with gussets to weather-proof the entrances to the box. Based on the diagrams above, we'll have one box for the battery and one box for the rest of the electronics.

## Other Miscellaneous Changes

The ramp to connect the main mechanism to the cargo trays was previously made out of flexible poncho material, but it was far too flimsy and light to function properly. We learned that a heavier yet still flexible material would work much better. Ultimately we settled on silicone - attached to the rods on the main mechanism using velcro.

We also want to have a proper pneumatics enclosure to protect the subsystem from rain/splashing. This was made using acrylic, and will also be a perfect place to add stickers of our sponsors.
