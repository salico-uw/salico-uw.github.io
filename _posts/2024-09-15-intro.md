title: What are we building?
---

*Salico* has partnered with Olakai Hawaii to help develop machinery to improve the efficiency of their sea asparagus farm.
More specifically, we plan to build a robot harvester which can traverse the farm autonomously.

We expect this to be a complex project, and are currently discussing different mechanisms to properly harvest the crops without damaging the plants.
Critically, traditional cutting-style harvesters such as combines cannot be used due to their cutting motions, which hinders their future growth.
Therefore, we are working to develop a mechanism which mimics the manual human harvesting method, which involves pulling instead of cutting.
